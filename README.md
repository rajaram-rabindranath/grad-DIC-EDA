"Code" --> Has all the scripts

	Each of the R scripts shared as part of the project submission has a variable "dataSourcePath" which must be initialized as follows:

	dataSourcePath <- "/home/raja/Education/sem 2/DIC/projects/prj1/data/census"

	Please assign the path of the folder which has the data to this variable. For the code to work this is necessary.

"Datasets" --> 
	
	The "Datasets" folder under the "Census" folder has the census data rda named "census.rda"
	
	The other datasets need to be placed in their respective folders as above.
